Also customizable by the user. Besides VMs, Rubrik can backup nearly every critical asset, like physical servers, databases, network shares, cloud ressources and lots more.

I have used Avira Antivirus on my personal laptop for about four or five years. I started using it because at that time I used another antivirus and its operation was not the most optimal since every so often I infected my laptop with viruses, trojans or spyware ... (I know that much of that is my fault because at that time I was downloading programs from any site and I was not careful). Due to these constant infections, I decided to look in the forums for some recommendations for antivirus and in a casual way (after using several different antiviruses), I reached Avira Antivirus. The truth is that my decision to stay with Avira Antivirus has not disappointed me. From that moment, I do not remember having any new infections. It works much better than my previous antivirus because whenever it is faced with a malicious file, it warns me and gives me the option of ignoring or deleting the file, which is great.",[],[],"Avira Antivirus works well in the vast majority of scenarios where the user has a responsible use of browsing and downloading content from different websites. If you habitually use your laptop to navigate in secure pages (newspapers, YouTube, Facebook, mail, among others) and to download content from safe places or without too much risk, you should not have major problems, as it usually warns and blocks the self-downloading content of link shorteners and similar pages. It also warns about dangerous pages and those where the credentials were altered or where they have had recent reports of infections.If instead, you are a user that jumps from one page to another, downloads files from anywhere, uses crack or patches for programs or games, well ... Avira will not be so useful, as it will eventually pass some malicious code and infect your PC. So if you are going to use your PC in that way, I recommend using a more powerful antivirus, but always remembering that no matter what antivirus you use, if you have risky behavior, at some point your PC will be attacked and your antivirus will not be able to do anything.","[""In my case, it detects the vast majority of malicious files.

A payroll type we have never used before was created called ""Non-Taxable Per Diem"" where entries were made on 9 out of 13 active employees.

Able to access all work applications, emails, etc. without having to be at the office or have duplicate software packages at remote offices. 2. To provide support to staff members without having to be in their office/cubicle spaces. Both for technical support and for workflow assistance. Again, especially helpful with Covid protocols. No need to be in close proximity, sitting in employees' chairs, touching their keyboards and mice, etc. Can assist all staff from the comfort of my own computer screen.",[],[],"For our use, or for colleagues who would be in similar situations, it is very well suited.

I will say that having a dodgy internet connection as I do at my remote location - the price of enjoying small-town living - makes it feel a bit like you're trying to move ""underwater"" waiting for each click of the mouse to register.

There is a logical flow, from when entries are made, to how they feed into some of the other modules. For example, posting a simple prepaid entry will have it flow into Intacct's prepaid module where it will automatically create amortization schedules for you, to which you can tweak/post the amortization to your liking.",[],[],"I think Intacct is well-suited for small, and mid-sized organizations.

I think Intacct would be less appropriate when used for much larger organizations as I find certain areas of Intacct can be slow if you have a lot of customers, or if you want data to go from one module to another quickly (e.g. AP Bills --> Prepaids module requires a 5-minute wait).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can use all the modules to help troubleshoot, for example,

security team, we can use device tracker to locate the device and shut the switch

The capabilities of Miro as a virtual whiteboard; It enables creating objects and relations in a very similar way as, if meeting in person, you would gather around a physical whiteboard and draw or move sticky notes around, to help visualise the concepts that you are speaking about and get everyone on the same page, instead of having each person hold their own perspective on their heads.

While you can make it look as one of those planning tools, every element needs to be created manually: you cannot set up smart rules or automation, as you can with specialised planning software (e.g. Trello or Asana).

The receipt and recording of rents is apt as is the work order flow. When we signed up for AppFolio Property Manager we communicated to every point of contact from the sales agent to the implementation team, that our revenue model stems from marking up bills and services 10%.  Everyone told us repeatedly that this was EASILY accomplished through AppFolio Property Manager.  Once we spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours on implementation, we now realize that those representations were, in my opinion, false.  In our old software, markups could be accomplished at the bill level (click a button for markup or discount and input the percentage). In my experience in AppFolio Property Manager, to mark up a bill or service, numerous steps are required. First you must create a work order where detailed information must be input (who creates a work order for a home-depot bill?); close the work order and then go to the work order page, select the work order and ""create bill"" from the work order; enter all the same detailed information plus additional information; mark up the bill and save; then go to payables, insert bank account and vendor to find the bill - then pay the bill. In my experience when entering 100 home-depot charges on the other software, we would go to vendor, select ""mark up"" and the percentage, then enter the 100 charges by property; save the bill and then pay it.  This might take 20 minutes.  In our experience in AppFolio Property Manager, for us to make our profit which enables us to stay in business and pay our AppFolio Property Manager fees, rent, payroll etc., we have to spend ALL DAY creating work orders for every separate home-depot charge and then hop through all of the other hoops and do it 99 other times. My entire office is so frustrated and we cannot focus on marketing, leasing, work orders or getting new business because we are spending all day jumping through all of these hoops to achieve our mark up. In our experience, we reach out to customer service again and again and are only answered by bots.  The bots are no help so our issue escalates to a real person. The person is no help and escalates the issue.  Ive been told 10 times that i will receive an emailed answer to my question - but no email has arrived and our issue remains unaddressed. In our experience, we are then pointed to ""suggestion boards"" where there is nothing but dissatisfied AppFolio Property Manager customers who are not receiving answers to their issues.

Azure is the right solution for anyone looking to offset high initial server cost in favor of low recurring monthly payments until the project begins to draw in revenue.Should you host the solution yourself?

I am a firm believer in having offsite/cloud as well as onsite backup for redundancy and speed of restores from archive.  My use case covers my individual machine which has my open source projects as well as my personal data.",,,"As part of a 3-2-1 backup strategy on MacOS - (3 forms of backup, at least 2 different technologies, and at least 1 offsite), IDrive Online Backup and Object Storage e2 works great in tandem with my TimeMachine and DropBox backups.  It backs up any mounted volumes.  Archiving (for history vs. just the most recent copy) is, like TimeMachine, invaluable, as often you don't need the most recent copy (which might be bad) but a previous one.  The interaction with DropBox wasn't perfect: my Documents and Downloads are DropBox monitored, which means that they are symbolic links to my DropBox folder.  After the initial install, those links were NOT followed and so IDrive Online Backup and Object Storage e2 was not backing up those areas, which was not what I expected.  Luckily I scrutinized the backup areas, and what was stored in the online web interface, and did a sample restore. Also, I use Quicken for MacOS which stores my datafiles in my '~/Library/Application Support' directory; by default that area is NOT monitored by IDrive Online Backup and Object Storage e2 either.  So my advice is: after the install configures its defaults, review it very carefully to make sure your data is covered properly.  Easy to install, easy to setup (other than my earlier gripes about the UX), easy to test.  The shortcomings in monitored folders just requires diligence.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
